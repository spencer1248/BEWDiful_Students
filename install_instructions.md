##Ubuntu Linux Users

1. __Open a terminal window__
  * http://askubuntu.com/questions/196212/how-do-you-open-a-command-line

2. __Install git__
  * ```sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core```

3. __Install curl__
  * ```sudo apt-get install curl```

4. __Install RVM__
  * ```\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby```
  * The backslash in font of "curl" is not a typo.
  * ```rvm use 2.0.0 --default```

##Windows Users

1. __Install VirtualBox__
  * https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. __Download Ubuntu Linux__
  * http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
  * Version 13.04 is probably preferable but 12.04 is also fine.

3. __Create your virtual machine__
  * Open VirtualBox and click the "New" button
  * Enter any name
  * Select "Linux" as the type
  * Select either "Ubuntu" or "Ubuntu (64 bit)" as the version depending on
    which you downloaded.
  * Memory size is the amount of your RAM that will be used to run
    Linux. 1024MB should be more than enough, but if you have a lot of
    RAM you can boost this number. If your machine only has 1GB of RAM
    then 512MB will have to do. If you're not sure, don't worry because
    this value can be changed later.
  * Hard drive - Select "Create a virtual hard drive now" then use the
    "VDI" type and then the "Dynamically allocated" option. Name the
    virtual hard drive file anything and select an amount of hard drive
    space that your computer is capable of supporting. 8GB should be plenty.

  * After clicking "Create", select the new virtual machine you created
    in the left column and press the "Start" button.
  * In the "Select start-up disk" window, select the Ubuntu Linux .iso
    file you downloaded and press start. You can then follow the Ubuntu
    installation instructions.

4. __Setup Ubuntu__
  * Now see the the installation instructions for Ubuntu Linux!

##Happy Coding :)

__You're ready for the first class.__
